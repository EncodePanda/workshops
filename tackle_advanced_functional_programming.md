## INTRODUCTION
This workshop is designed for all those interested in learning functional programming, and in tackling real world problems that they must solve every day in their work. Functional programming brings sanity to our industry, as it gives us the ability to handle complexity with modular and composable code. We must keep in mind, however that functional programming is not a magic wand that will suddenly make complexity disappear. If your problem is relatively difficult, simple immutable data structures and function composition will not suffice. Complexity is hard, but simplicity is not easy, either. The good news is, all the problems you regularly encounter were solved decades ago. If you know the solutions, you wonâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel.

## RELEVANCY
Developers should attend this session if they are interested in functional programming in general and are seriously devoted to taking their next big plunge down this rabbit's hole.


## CONCEPTS & SKILLS
This talk will offer the chance for attendees to acquire the following skills:
- Understanding fundamental FP concepts
- Ability to write your first FP programs with confidence
- A variety of skills to tackle complexity in FP-based code bases
- Ability to read the Scalaz and Cats code base

This talk will cover the following concepts:
- Algebraic Data Types
- Type classes
- Monad
- Functor
- Applicative
- Reader
- State
- Monad transformers
- MTL (Monad Transformers Library)
- Free monad

## COURSE OUTLINE
The idea of this session is to offer a series of iterations where we:
1. take an initial problem
2. add complexity to it
3. address the complexity with an existing FP concept
In this way, the audience will not only learn what each concept means but also why it exists.
